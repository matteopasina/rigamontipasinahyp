            <p>Warm weather is finally upon us. So break out the flip-flops and head outdoors to soak in the fun. The city is awash in new places to socialize, like an Art Deco bathhouse restored on the Rockaway Peninsula, and a floating bar moored off Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The party circuit continues in the Hamptons and on Fire Island. And for those stuck in Manhattan, there are rooftop events galore.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/03/fashion/Where-to-Party-This-Summer-in-New-York.html?ref=fashion"> Learn more</a>

            <p>Using less than a drop of blood, a new test can reveal nearly every virus a person has ever been exposed to, scientists reported on Thursday. The test, which is still experimental, can be performed for as little as $25 and could become an important research tool for tracking patterns of disease in various populations, helping scientists compare the old and the young, or people in different parts of the world. It could also be used to try to find out whether viruses, or the bodyâ€™s immune response to them, contribute to chronic diseases and cancer, the researchers said.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/health/single-blood-test-for-all-virus-exposures.html?ref=health"> Learn more</a>

            <p>Completing a marathon can be exhilarating but also agonizing. Thighs cramp. Backs ache. Toes bleed. Stomachs churn. Afterward, leg muscles can become so sore and tight that finishers must ease themselves backward down stairs and request assistance to rise from the toilet. Yet, despite these aches and indignities, many of us who have finished a marathon will eagerly sign up later for another, to the occasional bafflement of friends or loved ones who saw us after the first race, peeling off bloody socks. A new psychological study offers some explanation of why people do this, by finding that some marathon runners seem to develop selective amnesia, forgetting over time just how much they hurt. But the extent of that amnesia may depend on how much someone enjoyed the race. Most of us know intuitively that pain is to some extent subjective. Cut yourself or pound your feet against the pavement for 26.2 miles and, objectively, you will feel discomfort.<a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/03/forgetting-the-pain-of-exercise/?ref=health"> Learn more</a>
